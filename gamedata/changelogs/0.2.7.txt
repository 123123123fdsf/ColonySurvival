0.2.7 (2017-**-**)

Things you'll probably notice:

-Limit audio distance properly (i.e, don't hear farmers/miners from 100 meters away)

Things you may notice depending on use case:

-Updated the fr-FR localization (covers more)
-Added a sort of basic mod api (for C# code) to the server

Things you probably won't notice unless it affects your use case:

-Changed server to connect to the loopback IP directly for singleplayer instead of "localhost"
-Fix types.json & crafting.json to adhere to json spec
-Fix json writer to adhere to spec for booleans.
-Allow miners to be placed on blocks that aren't the lowest layer (can't obtain infinite blocks legit though)
-Add setting in types.json to make a block mineable by the miner.
-Revamp npc texture pipeline (removed /cache/ folder, merged some textures)
-Added NPCCount & MonsterCount stats to the server
-Fixed server log breaking with multiline messages
-Fixed the game sort of breaking if there are blocks in the world that do not exist in types.json anymore.
-Moved texture mapping types.json to the server (gamedata/texturemapping.json now)
