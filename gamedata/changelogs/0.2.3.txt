-Added Brazilian Portugese localization
-Updated japanese localization to 0.2.0 (and minor fixes) (via github)

-Fixed allowing the server to run multiple times at once.
--Now you can only run 1 server at the same time per game install.
--To host a server and play singleplayer at the same time copy the server to another folder.
-Made a seperate rendering system for custom meshed blocks using instancing

--Framerate is much much more consistent, and slightly higher in most situations
--Allows use of normal/height maps on meshed blocks
-Fixed inaccurate player collision in 1 direction
-Fixed inability to jump caused by low framerate ( < 15 or so, also fixes jumping during lag spikes)
-Fixed a case where monsters would just walk back and forward; they only retarget if their new target is actually closer (path-wise instead of direct)
-Fixed the inability of zombies to recalculate a path (they won't walk into a block and die one after another anymore)
-Fixed an issue causing torch shadows to update excessively
-Fixed issues caused by the game assuming another current directory than the one it is contained it.
-Fixed the fully grown wheat stage using the banner's albedo color
-Halved cpu use of rendering point lights
