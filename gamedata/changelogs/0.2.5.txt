0.2.5 (2017-07-05)

-Added russian localization
-Moved types.json to the server; the client downloads it from there.
--Includes drop types/amounts upon removing an item, destruction time per block
-Moved parts of settings/client.json to the server; 
--See settings/serverperclient.json for the list.
--Includes building speed, jumping, gravity, drag, swim speeds, fall damage
-Added version checking to the client and the server, to prevent incompatible combinations.

Later fix:
-Fixed singleplayer/localhost networking not being able to properly send larger files
--Fixes the stuck on "waiting for world" (hopefully)
--The types.json exceeded the tcp buffer size
